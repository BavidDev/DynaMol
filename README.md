# MolDyn
A non professional-grade MD simulator. 

With this project I strive to create an interactible tool to visualise the typically theoretical and equation-oriented world of microscale chemistry. 
This tool should NOT be used to create professional reliable data, its just for fun and I in no way put my focus on reliable accuracy. Nonetheless it could definetely be used
as a learning tool, haveeee fuuuuunnnnnnnn
